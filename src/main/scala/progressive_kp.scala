/**
  * This is a package with which we can apply a progressive K&P algorithm.
  * The advantage here is that we have access to this parallel graph coloring algorithm, but the algorithm
  * scales according to the strength of the cluster.
  * *
  * For t-way problems, this algorithm will be effective when the number of parameters is much bigger than the interaction strength
  * For instance, t=2, n=100, v=2 is a great problem for graph coloring with K&P. Many iterations are done in parallel.
  * because the graph is quite sparse (not dense).

/**
  * The main data structures we need for this algorithm are :

  * for every iteration
  *
  * In this algorithm, we map over every vertex every iteration to color the graph.
  * The tiebreakers are the ids of the vertices.
  * By regenerating these ids every time (by shuffling the t-way combos, we will get a different result
  * every time.
  *
  *
  * MAP :
  * ADJLIST + bcast colors =====>   COLOR OR NO COLOR
  * Return colors to master, broadcast colors again. Repeat until all this batch has been done.
  *
  * Then generate more adjlists and repeat the process until everything is colored.
